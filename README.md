# unit-4-game
jQuery homework game, week 4.

1. What the project does:
This project will allow a user to click each crystal that has an assigned numerical value between 1-12.  As the user clicks the crystals the value of each crystal will accumulate to give them a score.  If the user can get their score to equal the random target score between 19-120 then the user will win, otherwise, they lose.

2. Why the project is useful:
This project is useful because it introduced us to jquery which allows us to utilize the javascript library in a more efficient manner.

3. How users can get started with the project:
Users will want to start by clicking the crystals so they can figure out which number equals which crystal in order to get the their score to match the target score.  They will also want to reach the ReadMe file and/or the directions to the game.

4. Where users can get help with your project:
If someone is trying to replicate the project I would encourage them to watch YouTube videos of others who have completed this project.  It is also important to have a basic understanding of html, css, javascript and jquery.

5. Who maintains and contributes to the project:
This project was maintained and contributed by Will Altherr.  In order for me to complete this project I had to use resources within the following: https://www.w3schools.com/js/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCffhBVQldc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LSdLzAkK64
